This is a EPITECH Project

This project is based on a very famous game based on matchsticks.
There is a certain number of matchstick lines.
The two players take turns; each player can, on a same line, take one or several matchsticks.
The losing player is the one to take the last matchstick.

 To compile:
        make

 Execute:
        ./matchstick [nb_lines] [max_matches]

 Help:
        ./matchstick -h

 Bonus:
        See -h
        ./matchstick -c [nb_lines] [max_matches]
